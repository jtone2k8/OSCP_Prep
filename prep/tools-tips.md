# Tools/Tips

List of Tools to look into that I enjoyed using during my OSCP Prep

* Rustscan - super fast at finding open ports and passes over to nmap to do service scans
* Ghost pack - awesome tools for when you get a foothold on a windows box
* Whitewinterwolf's php web shell - love this web shell.
* Evilwinrm - I always forget about this when I have login creds
* Gobuster - dir scanner I was most comfy with
* Zap - if hydra didn't work then I went with zap to brute force over burp.
* Powershell-Empire With Starkiller - C2 framework that has lots of the Ghostpack tools included.
